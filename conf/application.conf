# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/), by providing a logger.xml file in the conf directory .

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# *** ReactiveMongo Plugin configuration *** #
# ****************************************** #

# Simple configuration (by URI)
# Here we use the simplest URI (connect to `localhost` using `databasename` as a database.)
#mongodb.uri = "mongodb://localhost/databasename"

# URI + Authentication
mongodb.uri =${?MONGODB}

# URI + Authentication + Replica Set
# This one connects to the following nodes (in the same replica set):
#   - host1 (using the default port, 27017)
#   - host2 (using the custom port 27018)
#   - 10.0.27.8 (using the custom port 27018)
# It uses the database `toto` with the credentials `jack` as a user and `jackpwd` as its password.
# mongodb.uri = "mongodb://jack:jackpwd@host1,host2:27018,10.0.27.8:27018/toto"

# Legacy configuration (prefer URI)
# mongodb.servers = ["localhost:27017"]
# mongodb.db = "databasename"

# If you want to turn on logging for ReactiveMongo, uncomment and customize this line
# logger.reactivemongo=DEBUG"
